# Combat

COMPSYS 302 (UoA) software project

Our project was to remake an old classic game (Combat by Atari) which would be suitable for 8 years olds to play. The game was developed using Java and Python and we did revamp the overall designs which might seem more appealing for younger kids. The report will include what the requirements were and if they were met and if so, how they were met, top level view of our game system (states), how some major issues during development was overcome, special features which were added and any improvements which could made for future reference.

This project consists of 2 parts:

1. Game logic written in Java (Combat_archive folder) Game logic consists of game structure including GUI/HUD, game objects like Tanks, walls, bullets and powerups. Users are allowed to use keyboard to controll their tank.

2. Local server node written in Python (python_server_archive folder) This part is responsible for multiplayer feature of the game which allows users to compete over the internet.

Please go to "docs" folder for more information about the development of this game.
