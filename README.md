# Combat_Game

COMPSYS 302 (UoA) software project

1. This is an archive for the project Combat with multiplayer feature created in 2016. The goal of the project is to design a simple game which is similar to combat, a game originally manufactured and sold by Atari in 1977, as a Java application that takes input from users and responds accordingly. This project consists of 2 parts:

2. Game logic written in Java (Combat_archive folder) Game logic consists of game structure including GUI/HUD, game objects like Tanks, walls, bullets and powerups. Users are allowed to use keyboard to controll their tank.

3. Local server node written in Python (python_server_archive folder) This part is responsible for multiplayer feature of the game which allows users to compete over the internet.

Please go to "docs" folder for more information about the development of this game.
